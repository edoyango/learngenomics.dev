# Genomic File Formats

When working with genomics data for the first time, many engineers are surprised
to find that genomics file types are quite simple in structure. In fact, <mark>a
majority of universal file formats such as
[SAM/BAM](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf),
[VCF](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf),
[BED](https://uswest.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/bed.html),
[GFF/GTF](https://uswest.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html)</mark> and many
other custom formats are essentially tab-delimited text files with some form of
compression and/or serialization. In this chapter, we cover the main file
formats one might run into when working in the genomics domain, starting with
common compression schemes.

Mastery of Unix command line tools such as `vim`,
`grep`, `less`, `cut`, `join`, `sort`, `sed`, and `awk` are essential to working
effectively in this domain. Be sure to brush up on your UNIX command line
skills!
